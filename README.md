Partition enumerator
====================

A class for enumerating all k-partitions of the set [n] = {1, ..., n}.  The class contains the method getNext(), which returns the "next" partition, or a null value when all partitions have been enumerated.  While it takes exponential time to enumerate all partitions, this implementation only uses O(k) space at any given time.  

Implemented in Python 2.7  and Matlab
